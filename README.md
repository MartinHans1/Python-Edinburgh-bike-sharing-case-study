# Python-Edinburgh-bike-sharing-case-study
A Python project using pandas to explore bikeshare data.

# Project Overview
This project focuses mainly on descriptive analysis of the bikeshare data in Edinburgh since September 2018 till June 2021. This project is part of the requirements for obtaining an engeto data analysis certificate: https://engeto.cz/datova-akademie/.

# Project details (1st part - bikesharing overview):
The first part of the project deals mainly with the following points:
    * Identifying active and inactive stations
    * Identifying most common stations 
    * Identifying the stations where the bikes are accumulating and the stations where they are potentially missing
    * Calculating the distances between the individual stations
    * Showing a histogram with the length of the loan and the extreme values
    
# Project details (2nd part - analysis of bikesharing demand):
The second part of the project deals mainly with the following points:
     * Viewing the development of the demand for bicycle rental over time
     * Identifying the causes of demand fluctuations
     * Finding out the effect of weather on the demand for bicycles
     * Do people rent bikes more on weekends than during the working week?
   
# Project Summary:
All research questions were answered. I have identified that an average bike rental takes approx. 32 minutes and 30 seconds. On the other hand, the shortest loan lasted about one minute while the longest 39389 minutes. An interesting finding was also that from March till October 2020 there was the biggest demand for bikesharing which was caused by the lowest monthly precipation from the observed period. From the analysis of the influence of the weather on the demand for bicycles, it is clear that with increasing real and sensory temperature and with increasing air pressure, the demand increases. Similarly, with declining wind and gust speeds, with declining rainfall, humidity and cloud cover, demand is also rising. People in Edinburgh prefer bike rentals in weekdays over weekends and the biggest demand for rentals is between 12 and 17 PM.
